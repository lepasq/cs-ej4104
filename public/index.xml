      <description>Why Devops  DevOps provides a lot of value in a team It reduces the time between the commit and the deployment of changes It increases stability and reliability  What do I think about this course? For someone who had never heard about DevOps, this would be a great course.
As someone who had already worked with Markdown and Hugo before, I did not learn too much.
I really liked the CI/CD part about this project, as it is somewhat challenging.</description>

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps provides a lot of value in a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It reduces the time between the commit and the deployment of changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It increases stability and reliability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-i-think-about-this-course&#34;&gt;What do I think about this course?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone who had never heard about DevOps, this would be a great course.&lt;br&gt;
As someone who had already worked with Markdown and Hugo before, I did not learn too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the CI/CD part about this project, as it is somewhat challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish there would have been a 5EC version of this course, similar to CS-E4190 (Cloud Software and Systems),
containing more things about Web Servers and Nginx, testing tools, managing servers, proxies, load balancers and monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-i-get-into-devops&#34;&gt;How did I get into DevOps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got first interested in DevOps, after installing Linux at the end of my first semester in my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.
First, I started messing around with Linux configuration files, ricing and vim.&lt;br&gt;
After a while, I learnt Docker and Docker-compose, started using CI/CD more often, and at some point I got really interested in the DevOps part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that &lt;a href=&#34;https://roadmap.sh/devops&#34;&gt;this roadmap&lt;/a&gt; gives a really nice overview, of the hard skills that a DevOps engineer requires.&lt;br&gt;
Next to knowledge of basic programming, knowledge of Operating Systems and Computer Networks are fundamental, as many activities interact with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next track that is suggested is to learn about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. This includes containerization using Docker,
Configuration Management using Ansible, Infrastructure Provisioning using Terraform and Container Orchestration using Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the mentioned tools, we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about in CS-E4190.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last milestones of the roadmap are about&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CI/CD such as Gitlab CI, GitHub Actions or Jenkins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud Providers, such as AWS, GCP or Digital Ocean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and Logging Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud design patterns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the things that I have not looked yet at all, are Monitoring, Cloud design patterns and Web Servers, such as Nginx.&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d also like to try and use Kubernetes. However, I find it hard to practice it without having an ongoing site that is used by many users,
as it could be hard to test it properly otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
