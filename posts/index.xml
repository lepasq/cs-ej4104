For someone who had never heard about DevOps, this would be a great course.
As someone who had already worked with Markdown and Hugo before, I did not learn too much.

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>DevOps provides a lot of value in a team&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It reduces the time between the commit and the deployment of changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It increases stability and reliability&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>For someone who had never heard about DevOps, this would be a great course.&lt;br>
As someone who had already worked with Markdown and Hugo before, I did not learn too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really liked the CI/CD part about this project, as it is somewhat challenging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish there would have been a 5EC version of this course, similar to CS-E4190 (Cloud Software and Systems),
containing more things about Web Servers and Nginx, testing tools, managing servers, proxies, load balancers and monitoring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-i-get-into-devops">How did I get into DevOps?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I got first interested in DevOps, after installing Linux at the end of my first semester in my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree.
First, I started messing around with Linux configuration files, ricing and vim.&lt;br>
After a while, I learnt Docker and Docker-compose, started using CI/CD more often, and at some point I got really interested in the DevOps part.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find that &lt;a href="https://roadmap.sh/devops">this roadmap&lt;/a> gives a really nice overview, of the hard skills that a DevOps engineer requires.&lt;br>
Next to knowledge of basic programming, knowledge of Operating Systems and Computer Networks are fundamental, as many activities interact with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next track that is suggested is to learn about &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Infrastructure as Code&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This includes containerization using Docker,
Configuration Management using Ansible, Infrastructure Provisioning using Terraform and Container Orchestration using Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the mentioned tools, we&amp;rsquo;ve learnt about in CS-E4190.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last milestones of the roadmap are about&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CI/CD such as Gitlab CI, GitHub Actions or Jenkins&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud Providers, such as AWS, GCP or Digital Ocean&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitoring and Logging Software&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud design patterns&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Some of the things that I have not looked yet at all, are Monitoring, Cloud design patterns and Web Servers, such as Nginx.&lt;br>
I&amp;rsquo;d also like to try and use Kubernetes. However, I find it hard to practice it without having an ongoing site that is used by many users,
as it could be hard to test it properly otherwise.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
