# DevOps
Hi! This is a small blog for a DevOps course that I'm taking at Aalto University.  

My main interests in Computer Science at the moment are Software Development, as well as Cloud and Network Infrastructure. The latter one is also closely connected to DevOps and Cloud Systems in general.  

DevOps is a discipline which aims to reduce the time between development and deployment and it is involved in things such as deployment, testing, infrastructure and stability of the system.  

Some widely used tools for DevOps are Cloud-providers, such as AWS or GCP, Terraform, Docker and Kubernetes.

Enjoy going through my blog and check out the posts below for more detail!
